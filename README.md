Windows batch scripts I've written.

1. WinSCP Batch script is specifically for manually backing up an Edgerouter config folder via ethernet using the built in SFTP/FTP server.
2. Robocopy_Mirror_HDD Manual is yet another manual backup script. Creates a mirror of HDD D:/ to HDD E:/ When combined with task scheduler it can mirror a drive. Good for situations where you forgot to setup RAID but still want a mirrored drive.
