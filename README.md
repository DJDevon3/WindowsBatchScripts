Windows batch scripts I've written.

1. WinSCP Batch script is specifically for manually backing up an Edgerouter config folder via ethernet using the built in SFTP/FTP server.
2. Manual file transfer from one HDD to another. Yet another manual backup script. When combined with task scheduler will synchronize two drives without the need for RAID.
